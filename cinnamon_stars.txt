Cinnamon Stars


Ingredients
===========

3 fresh egg whites
1 pinch salt
250 g icing sugar
1.5 tablespoons cinnamon
350 g ground almonds
0.5 tablespoons kirsch


Preparation
===========

Beat the egg whites with the salt until stiff. Mix in the icing sugar and continue beating until the mixture turns glossy. Cover and refrigerate 6 tablespoons (approx. 100 ml) of the mixture to use as icing later on.

Stir in the cinnamon and the Kirch to the remaining mixture. Then, add the almonds and mix to form a dough.


Shaping
=======

Roll out the dough on a lightly sugared surface to a thickness of approx. 1 cm. Cut out the stars, dipping the cutter in sugar each time. Place the cookies on a tray lined with baking paper.


Drying
======

Put a little icing on each star. Leave to dry at room temperature for approx. 6 hrs. or overnight.


Baking
======

Preheat the oven to 250Â°C. Bake for approx. 5 mins. in the centre of the oven.

Remove from the oven and cool the Cinnamon Stars on a cooling rack.
